/**
 * What is useReducer?
 * A React Hook used for managing complex state logic â€” especially when state depends on previous state or has multiple sub-values.
 * 
 * Why it exists?
 * It brings the Redux-style reducer pattern into React for situations where useState becomes cumbersome.
 * 
 * ðŸ“¦ Syntax Breakdown
 * const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
 * 
 * reducer: A pure function (state, action) => newState
 * dispatch: Function you call to trigger state updates
 * initialState: Your default state object
 * 
 * ðŸ§° When to Use useReduce
 * Use it when:
 * You manage multiple related state variables.
 * The next state depends on the previous state.
 * You want to keep logic out of your JSX.
 * Youâ€™re building complex forms, step wizards, or state machines.
 * you want a Redux-like pattern without Redux.
